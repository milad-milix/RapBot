When we die, the money we can't keep
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
That goin' to that owin' money that the court got
And you ain't gettin' money 'less you got eight figures
I guess the money should've changed him
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair
I treat the label like money from my shows
Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt
Most Blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa
And if they hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin
And I won't, give you that money that you asking for
This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship
I spent that gas money on clothes with logos
'Till then, get money and stunt and stay glorious
Never had money so I felt like a virgin
I make money, money don't make me
After all the money you earned, still show daddy what you learned
Stack my money tall, height advantage
But I ain't eva, eva, accept no money from these so called sponsors
The money I make on this one's for Donda
Since my money get right theses days
Flow so ugly, money so handsome
Tell them put the money in my hand right now (yes)
I'm tryin' to take this money like Rob and G. Dep
I have my money on my mind, I was thinking green
Swizz said she ain't got no money in the bank
