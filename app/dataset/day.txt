I'm talking George Tenet, I seen him the other day
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
What you doin' in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
Get your piece today
Niggas still gettin' popped on the day to day
24/7, 365 days, everybody gettin' paid
Until the day I get struck by lightning
I be Puerto Rican day parade floatin'
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Friday night tryna make it into the city
I be thinkin' every day
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, they line up for days
I've been trending years, y'all a couple days
In the projects one day, to Project Runway
Welcome to Sunday service, if you hope to someday serve us
I'mma need a day off, I think I'll call Ferris up
Had a conference with the DJs, Puerto Rico three days
(Ain't that where the Heat play? Niggas hate ballas these days) Yep!
If one day you just up and leave
Old folks talking bout back in my day
But homie this is my day
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
And on the 18th birthday he found out it wasn't his?!
That know the day that you play me
Would be the same day MTV play videos
I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died
Every problem you had before this day is now done
Sunday morning, praise the Lord
Modern day MJ with a off the wall flow
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' about
Good morning, on this day we become legendary
That'll be the same day I give the game back
One day I'm gon' marry a porn star
I'mma need a whole day, at least rolled doja
What party is we goin' to on Oscar day
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday
And I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
Before you ask me to go get a job today
With dreams of someday wearing a white dress
That's enough Mr. West, please, no more today
Says she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Fridays, I still have it my way
Niggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye
Lock yourself in a room doing 5 beats a day for 3 summers
But we gon' keep bakin' til the day we get cake
But every holiday nobody eating her food
I feel like one day you'll understand me, dog
One of my best friends from back in the day
Maybe one day girl we can bone
Feelin better than some head on a Sunday afternoon
Cause on judgment day, you gon' blame me
Sell it, the fiends cop it, nowadays they can't tell if
Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it
We can't dwell on the past all we got is today
So hopefully one day that real soul will eclipse
I am the day Ice Cube met Michael Jackson
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by 5
First day of school, I'mma take you sight seein'
13 Ghosts use my Hollow Man for Friday 13th
It's my birthday, I deserve to be greedy huh
Last birthday she got you a new sweater
Might have caught you clappin' every Sunday at church
Chainsmokin' every day, at least a couple packs
And the days been crazy and the nights even wilder
Where we flying, they can't find us all them broke days behind us
We need you to go deeper than Tay Zonday,"
One day I play Kobe
Man, will he come back and save the day?
Dreaming of the day they push a phantom to the operas
I swear since that day I've been treating fat hoes differently
I broke up with my girl today around 3-0
Y'all'll be back together in a day or two
Since my money get right theses days
Till one day I put an angel in your ultra sound
And we goin' have a hell of a night, through the day, I made her say
Yesterday I was half the man you see
Make black history every day, I don't need a month
Ok, I'm running from the light, running from the day to night
Until that day-o, she take the monorail
She said Yeah, I been spendin' all day tryin' to figure that out
I'm getting spins all day in L.A
