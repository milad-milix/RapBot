My girl a superstar all from a home movie
She say she only here for her girl birthday
Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
A country girl that love Hollywood
Uh, black girl sippin' white wine
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
And that girl ain't even religious
Baby girl tryna get a nut
And her girl tryna give it up
Only thing open is Waffle House, girl don't start with me
And just imagine how my girl feel
I met this girl when I was 3 years old
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
And you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name
Cause even when we're kissing baby girl feel different
The second girl with us, that's our wife
And I will, cut your girl like Pastor Tro'
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed
Oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
Ooh girl your breath is harsh!
Maybe one day girl we can bone
If my tips helped send a pretty girl through school
Now I'm with this girl for the rest of my life
'Bout the baddest girl I ever seen
You're like the girl from Misery
But if you don't need a fix, girl you gotta leave
Your girl don't like me, how long has she been gay?
I met this girl when I was 3 years old
Suck like ol girl got booed at Apollo
And get a girl who barely bra fit
When my girl be around, I see you peepin' me
I think my girl catchin' on cause my story keep changin' up
Baby girl you know I got bad nerves
In the G-string, girl I want you
Any girl I take out, Mediatakeout, I need a break now
Plus every good girl wanna go bad
That girl is so wired
You need a girl that's A List, not one that's just barely made it on a list
I'm with my girl and I'm tryin to hit the movies yo
This girl got a silicone booty!
His girl caught feelings, she mad, she threw the ring out
But if you keep it, then you gotta tell your girl you was cheatin'
So basically you and your girl over
There's only one girl on my agenda
My girl rocking the little lamb that Mary had
I broke up with my girl today around 3-0
Why you get ya, get ya, get ya pretty girl rock on
What a pretty girl like you doing in this part of town
With a city girl swag and a country girl smile
Baby girl you're dangerous
Baby girl you're dangerous
Special Ed got head from a girl in special ed
I lost the only girl in the world that know me best
My favorite girl wanna leave me just because I got a girlfriend
My freak girl told me now, she a Christian
My White girl wanna move back to Michigan
If I fall in love, a girl gon' live on rodeo
And I don't want no girl that will answer to "ayo"
Uh! And I'll be trying to come around my girl acting like Mr
Yow 'cuence this girl is bad
