I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
Last night was mad real
Then she said she impregnated, that's the night your heart died
We hanging out that window it's about to be a Suge night
Friday night tryna make it into the city
One cold night in October
Late-night organ donor
So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning
Sorry for the night demons still visit me
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
Last night ain't go so well, got kicked up out the hotel
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
Let's get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
'Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
'Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astoundin'
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
These dreams be waking me up at night
On nights when 'Ye romance
The glory, the story, the chain, the polo, the night
It's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came, I came, I came
On one of them bad nights, y'all have a bad fight
I thought I'd be with you for only one night
I'mma play this Gladys Knight,me and you, gon' get right
You wanna kill the vibe on another night
You wanna complain about the nights alone
Up late night like she on patrol
That night (that night) that night
Merry Christmas to all, and all a good night
It's still, wonderful night to be alive, baby
Never meant to hurt you, I should've had nights off
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astoundin'
And at the end of the night bae
Know you've been workin' that body all night
Yeah, tonight I see some super freaky hoes
And the days been crazy and the nights even wilder
Its slaughter ever since I opened up that midnight merrauder?
Tonight I'm finna hop up in that hotel pool
I know you're living your life for the night, another night
So I guess I'll see you in my nightmares
So at the end of the night, you ain't even gotta ask
I'm talkin' only for a night, I wouldn't wife her
Remember those nights on the kitchen sink
Keisha Knight-Pull, Emmanuel
Ain't no tellin they gon' love you after tonight
Shakespearian midsummer night dream
The show tonight
If I come in the middle of the night, then Myleka I'mma do whatever you like
L.A. for a night, then return on the red eye
And we goin' have a hell of a night, through the day, I made her say
Where'd you come from on this lonely night?
On, I let my nightmares go
Let me see what we have tonight, I'm high as a satellite
I see those flashing lights cause every night, every night, I put on
Tonight man I ain't in the mood for it
Well tonight I'm tryin' to find them other girls
Ok, I'm running from the light, running from the day to night
Told her I ain't paying tonight I'm only browsing
Its way too much to handle in one night
And if I see Biggie tonight, I loved every minute
