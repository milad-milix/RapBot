Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
I swear I've been on this flight like a month right now
And grabbed it with a slight grind
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Like a flight with no visa
The light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard
This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine
Rented the whole bottom floor for a candlelight dinner
Tell Peaches light the herb cause we just reunited
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
Oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
And wakin up with a slight cough
So celebrate and light the Mary Jane
My recital is as bright as the light show up at the Eiffel
I just remembered that my limelight extra-bright
And I drive so fast I blur the light post
And steal the spotlight like Mr. Bentley
