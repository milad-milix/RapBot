Hey baby you forgot your Ray Bans
But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Your baby daddy won't even take your daughter shoppin' (Yo!)
Keep the work at my baby mama's mama's house
Well that's cool, baby girl, do ya thang
I said baby what if you was clubbin'
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
He got that ambition baby look in his eyes
She need her daddy, baby please
"Ease up there, baby boy": Ving Rhames told Jody that
Ain't no denying baby you have changed
Cause even when we're kissing baby girl feel different
If I be with you, baby I'm confused
You be up in mine checking through my cell phone baby no
Why you walk around with a baby cross's cousin?
So fly baby, my baby so high
Don't get it twisted, baby boy, I'll Ving Rhames you
Hey baby what it feel like, ahhh
And the lights even brighter, baby stand next to my fire
So real you so trill. baby everything legit
And if that baby purr, I'm gonna baby her
Cause your ice so brrr I copped you a baby fur
I'm so Flava, I'm so Flava, baby I should have a clock on
What you mean baby girl, I got homes
We were never meant to be baby we just happened
Woe is me baby this is tragic
They say they shop on eBay --baby why is they frontin'?
So come here baby girl
