A hot temper, matched with a cold killer
Then they ran up and shot him, right in front of his mom
Don't leave while you're hot that's how Mase screwed up
And I'm feelin' it right now, cause it's the time when my heart got shot down
It's gettin' hot in here, that's all that I know
Hands up, hands up, then the cops shot us
And throw him some hot cars
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
Why he keep giving me hot lines?
For the drunk and hot girls
Some drunk and hot girls
You drunk and hot girl
You drunk and hot girl
You drunk and hot girl
You drunk and hot girl
You drunk and hot girl
You drunk and hot girl, yeah
That drunk and hot girl
Gave her the hot chocolate, she said “It's Dee-ricious”
Long for their shot on the TV screens
So popular you should get a shot of us
You gonna be hot a little while, I'mma be rich forever
