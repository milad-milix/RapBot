Niggas still gettin' popped on the day to day
Until the day I get struck by lightning
I be Puerto Rican day parade floatin'
Friday night tryna make it into the city
Welcome to Sunday service, if you hope to someday serve us
I'mma need a day off, I think I'll call Ferris up
If one day you just up and leave
And on the 18th birthday he found out it wasn't his?!
That know the day that you play me
Would be the same day MTV play videos
I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died
Every problem you had before this day is now done
Sunday morning, praise the Lord
Modern day MJ with a off the wall flow
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' about
Good morning, on this day we become legendary
That'll be the same day I give the game back
One day I'm gon' marry a porn star
With dreams of someday wearing a white dress
Niggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye
Lock yourself in a room doing 5 beats a day for 3 summers
But we gon' keep bakin' til the day we get cake
But every holiday nobody eating her food
I feel like one day you'll understand me, dog
Maybe one day girl we can bone
Feelin better than some head on a Sunday afternoon
Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it
So hopefully one day that real soul will eclipse
I am the day Ice Cube met Michael Jackson
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by 5
First day of school, I'mma take you sight seein'
13 Ghosts use my Hollow Man for Friday 13th
Last birthday she got you a new sweater
Might have caught you clappin' every Sunday at church
One day I play Kobe
Dreaming of the day they push a phantom to the operas
I swear since that day I've been treating fat hoes differently
I broke up with my girl today around 3-0
Y'all'll be back together in a day or two
Till one day I put an angel in your ultra sound
Yesterday I was half the man you see
Ok, I'm running from the light, running from the day to night
She said Yeah, I been spendin' all day tryin' to figure that out
I'm getting spins all day in L.A
