First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Baby, you're fired, your girlfriend hired
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
And bring a friend for my friend, his name Kweli
My friend showed me pictures of his kids
Stop dancing with your girlfriend and come dance with me
Stop talking 'bout your boyfriend since he is not me
He don't like his mama's boyfriend just like me
How a friend only gonna watch that, it's so weak
And I'mma call your best friend up just to stab
"What happened Teesha, your boyfriend come fast?"
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'm gon' ask him
